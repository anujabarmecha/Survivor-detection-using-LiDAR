# Survivor Detection Using LiDAR  

This project processes **LiDAR point cloud data** to detect potential survivors in disaster-stricken areas. It uses **Open3D, PyntCloud, and Plotly** for visualization, along with machine learning techniques for classification.  

##  Features  
✅ Reads and processes **.PLY (LiDAR) files**  
✅ Performs **feature extraction** on 3D point cloud data  
✅ Uses **ML techniques** for survivor classification  
✅ Provides **interactive 3D visualizations**
